# slab-gritty-grilles - 3 modes (Euclidean/Drum/Clock div) and improved MIDI Implementation for Grids
slab-gritty-grilles is a mix of 3 open source firmwares.

The original Mutable Instruments firmware.

The unofficial SlowGrowth firmware which was adding a 3rd mode to the standard MI code. So we had Euclidean/Drum/Clock div modes (You can check how the clock divisions mode works here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0N1J-62FYf0]video here).

The Gritty-Grids firmware: https://github.com/sonic-insurgence/Gritty-Grids which improved the MIDI Implementation for Grids.

On my Grilles versions we were able to clock it via MIDI (MIDI in on the front panel). But it was not possible to start/stop/pause in sync with external MIDI with for instance the Machinedrum or other Elektron gear. Now with the Gritty-Grids improvements, it is possible.
